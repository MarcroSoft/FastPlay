# FastPlay

A fast, accessible audio player for Windows and macOS with support for tempo/pitch shifting, effects, and screen reader accessibility.

## Features

- Tempo, pitch, and rate adjustment (Speedy for speech, Signalsmith Stretch for music)
- Audio effects (reverb, echo, EQ, compressor, stereo width, center/vocal cancel, convolution, 3D audio)
- Recording to WAV, MP3, OGG and FLAC
- MIDI with SoundFonts, and tracker modules
- Internet radio streaming with favorites
- YouTube audio playback
- Screen reader support via Universal Speech
- Hotkey support
- Chapter navigation for audiobooks

## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2022** (or its Build Tools) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
  - Download from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- **CMake** 3.21 or newer
- **Git** (CMake fetches some dependencies with it)

## Dependencies

Run `download-deps.bat` once. It downloads SQLite, Speedy, Sonic, KissFFT,
Signalsmith Stretch and FDK AAC into `deps/` and `src/`, and FastPlay's FFmpeg
into `ffmpeg/`: the audio-only build CI makes with `ci/ffmpeg/build.sh`, taken
from CI's latest run with the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login` first).

wxWidgets (the user interface toolkit), UniversalSpeech (screen reader speech),
miniaudio, SpessaSynth, libopenmpt, LAME, libogg and libvorbis are fetched and
built by CMake itself on the first build.

## Building

Open a command prompt and run:

```batch
build_new.bat
```

This configures CMake in `build/`, builds `FastPlay.exe`, and packages
`FastPlay.zip` (and `FastPlayInstaller.exe` when Inno Setup is installed). The
first build takes a while because it compiles wxWidgets; later builds reuse it.

### Build Options

Disable screen reader support:
```batch
build_new.bat no-speech
```

## Running

After building, run `FastPlay.exe`. The screen reader client DLLs are loaded from the `lib/` subfolder.
